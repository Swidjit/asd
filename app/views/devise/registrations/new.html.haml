      %h5 Paricipate at your own risk
      %p Inviting people over to your house has risks, as does going to dinner at someone else's house.  Heck, even eating food comes with various risks.  If you choose to participate in this meal-sharing, you must do so aware of these risks and willing to take responsibility for what comes to pass.  Whatever happens, we are not responsible for it.
      %h5 Mind your manners
      %p Hateful or aggressive behavior is not welcome in this community.  If you are unable to maintain civility during meals or online interactions, your dining privileges may be revoked.
